Sign Language Recognition using AIML
This project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures through an AI/ML model. It uses the ASL dataset to train a deep learning model, allowing real-time recognition and translation of gestures into text.


Features
ASL Gesture Recognition: Detects and translates basic ASL gestures.
Real-Time Detection: Supports live gesture recognition via webcam.
Text Translation: Converts recognized gestures into text.
Technologies
Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, PyCharm

Download Dataset: Obtain the ASL dataset and place it in the project directory.
Usage
Train the Model: python train_model.py
Real-Time Detection: python real_time_detection.py
Evaluate Model: python evaluate_model.py
Future Improvements
Expanded Gesture Support and Improved Model Accuracy.
